# RNA Secondary Visualizer
This is the documentation for the project RNA Secondary Visualizer.
## Dependencies Needed
java and gcc need to be installed on the system. To build the files again, Doxygen and graphviz are also required.

## Running the Vizualizer
After extracting all the files to the same directory, on the terminal run:
```
> gcc main.c -o a
> ./a <RNA-Seq>
```
replace &lt;RNA-Seq&gt; with your RNA sequence bases (upper case - A, U, G, C).
Open `viz.svg` in any web browser;

## Opening the Documentation
After extracting all the files to the same directory, just open [Documentation](./index.html). Alternatively, you can open `documentation/html/index.html` file in any web browser.

## Code and Algorithm Analysis
The analysis of the algorithms and their code implementations are present in [About](../../index.html). Alternatively, open `index.html` from root folder in any web browser.
