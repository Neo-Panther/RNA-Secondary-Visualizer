# RNA Secondary Visualizer
This project aims to build a tool to create and visualize secondary structure of RNA from input base sequence.

## Dependencies Needed
java and gcc need to be installed on the system. To build the files again, Doxygen and graphviz are also required.

## Running the Vizualizer
After extracting all the files to the same directory, on the terminal run:
```
> gcc main.c -o a.exe
> ./a.exe <RNA-Seq>
```
replace &lt;RNA-Seq&gt; with your RNA sequence bases (upper case - A, U, G, C).
Open `viz.svg` in any web browser;

## Opening the Documentation
After extracting all the files to the same directory, just open [Documentation](.documentation/html/index.html). Alternatively, you can open `documentation/html/index.html` file in any web browser.

## Code and Algorithm Analysis
The analysis of the algorithms and their code implementations are present in [About](./index.html). Alternatively, open `index.html` in any web browser.
